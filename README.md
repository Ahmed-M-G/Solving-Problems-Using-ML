 - ## auto_mpg.ipynb
   **Simple Linear Regression for Automobile mpg Data**
   
   * In this Task, you will see how to:
     * Load data from a text file using the `pandas` package
     * Create a scatter plot of data
     * Handle missing data
     * Fit a simple linear model
     * Plot the linear fit with the test data
     * Use a nonlinear transformation for an improved fit

- ## glucose.ipynb
   **Predicting Glucose Levels using Multiple Linear Regression**

   * In this Task, you will learn how to:
