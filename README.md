 - ## auto_mpg.ipynb
   **Simple Linear Regression for Automobile mpg Data**
   
   * In this Task, you will see how to:
     * Load data from a text file using the `pandas` package
     * Create a scatter plot of data
     * Handle missing data
     * Fit a simple linear model
     * Plot the linear fit with the test data
     * Use a nonlinear transformation for an improved fit

- ## glucose.ipynb
   **Predicting Glucose Levels using Multiple Linear Regression**

   * In this Task, you will learn how to:
     * Fit multiple linear regression models using the python `Sklearn` package.  
     * Split data into training and test.
     * Manipulate and visualize multivariable arrays.

- ## polyfit.ipynb
   **Polynomial Model Order Selection**

   * In this Task, we will illustrate the process of cross-validation for model order selection.  We demonstrate the concepts via polynomial fitting using synthetic data. 
     * Characterize the model order for a simple polynomial model
     * Measure training and test errors for a given model order
     * Select a suitable model order using cross-validation
     * Plot the results for the model order selection process
